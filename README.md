# Online-Voting-System
The system is a secure community-scale online voting platform. It is designed for small to medium-sized organizations (e.g., student associations, clubs, professional groups, or workplaces) rather than large-scale government elections. The domain focuses on controlled elections where the primary concerns are fairness, accessibility, etc.
